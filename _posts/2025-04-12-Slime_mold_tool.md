## What is this all about?

My team is working on a game called [Katharsi](../Katharsi). And this plugin is a tool for artists to spread the slime mold around the game environment. 

> There is a [github repo](https://github.com/SmailikHappy/SlimeMoldTool) with this plugin

In this article I will explain how our team uses this plugin and how you can use it in your project.\
Below there should be a video of the tool in action (This video will be changed for a better one).
