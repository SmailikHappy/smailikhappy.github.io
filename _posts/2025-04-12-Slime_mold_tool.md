## What is this all about?

My team is working on a game called [Katharsi](../Katharsi). This plugin was created as a tool for artists to spread the slime mold (the goop) around in a game environment. In this article I will explain what is this plugin and how it works.

> There is a [github repo](https://github.com/SmailikHappy/SlimeMoldTool) with this plugin. I explain there how you can use it in your project.

## First paragraph

This plugin implements a new editor mode with 2 tools:

- **Skeleton tool** - a tool to place points and connect them with lines
- **Mesh tool** - has buttons to call associated delegates in the actor a user is editing and exposes the user's custom properties
