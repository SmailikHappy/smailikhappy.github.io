## General information

I developed a tower defense game entirely in C++, utilizing a template provided by [3Dgep.com](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-2-template/).

It was an intake project for the university. The objective was to develop a game entirely in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Prior to this project, I had only worked on small projects and algorithms that didn't involve working with objects and classes. Thus, this project represented a significant leap in my technical skills, as I learned and applied the fundamentals of OOP.

> This project was undertaken during my early stages as a programmer, and my main objective was to learn new concepts rather than produce polished code. As a result, **<u>the quality of the code is lacking.</u>**

## Features

- 4 different towers with different attacks
- multiple enemies with different behaviour and vulnerabilities
- randomly generated map every new game
- tower buy / sell / upgrade system
- pause / play, normal and fast game speeds

> There is a [GitHub](https://github.com/SmailikHappy/Frozen-defense) repo with this project! More information can be found there
