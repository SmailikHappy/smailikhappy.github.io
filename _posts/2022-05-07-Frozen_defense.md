## General information

I developed a tower defense game entirely in C++, utilizing a template provided by [3Dgep.com](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-2-template/).

There is a [GitHub](#) repo with this project!
*Need to put the project on the github*

It was an intake project for the university. The objective was to develop a game entirely in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Prior to this project, I had only worked on small projects and algorithms that didn't involve working with objects and classes. Thus, this project represented a significant leap in my technical skills, as I learned and applied the fundamentals of OOP.

The game itself has 4 different towers with different attacks, multiple enemies with different protection rules and a procedurally generated map every new game. It took me 3 weeks to learn OOP and create that nice game.
