I developed a tower defense game with a winter theme entirely in C++, utilizing a template provided by [3Dgep.com](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-2-template/).

*Need to put the project on the github*

## Additional information about the project

It was an intake project for the university. The objective was to develop a game entirely in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Prior to this project, I had only worked on small projects and algorithms that didn't involve working with objects and classes. Thus, this project represented a significant leap in my technical skills, as I learned and applied the fundamentals of OOP.
