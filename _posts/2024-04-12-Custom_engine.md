## General information

This is a group project completed at university as part of a course assignment. The team consisted of 6 programmers. The goal was to develop a cross-platform game engine for PC and PS5 that is suitable to create first person shooters.\
In the end, project had:
- Jolt physics library
- Keyboard, mouse and gamepad inputs
- PBR rendering *(provided by the template)*
- Variance shadow mapping
- Animations
- Blender plugin for level editing
- Level import pipeline directly from Blender
- Entity component system *(provided by the template)*
- Asset managment *(provided by the template)*

Everything above mentioned worked on both PC Windows and PS5 systems.

During the project, I deepened my knowledge in graphics and blender scripting, learned CI/CD pipeline and applied it in team work. It is worth to mention, I got some crucial lessons on why do we need peer code checks, team code style agreement and automize the process of code merging.

## Personal contribution

- I created shadows using variance sadow mapping technique on both platofrms
- I developed a big part of blender plugin - object property panel and custom object variable export
