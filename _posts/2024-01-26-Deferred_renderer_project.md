## General infromation

This is a self-study project that implements deferred lighting as core of rendering pipeline, with support for physically based rendering (PBR). The renderer is written in C++ for the PS5 using a low-level **Prospero** API.

This project was undertaken as part of a university course assignment aimed at deepening expertise in a desired topic. I chose to focus on exploring new methods to optimize the renderer and delving deeper into low-level graphic APIs.
The project codebase cannot be shared due to a protection of NDA, but there are some images!

I wrote an [article](/posts/Deferred_renderer_article) about how it works.
