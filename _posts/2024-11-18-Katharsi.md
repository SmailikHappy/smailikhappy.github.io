## Personal contribution

### The slime mold / goop

According to the project brief, the game takes place in a decayed cathedral. Our team chose an underground environment featuring a living slime mold to represent corruption and gloom. Interacting with the mold causes it to dissolve, serving as both a gameplay mechanic and a narrative symbol of healing.\
After the first eight weeks, all the technical artists who were intended to implement the corruption left the team, creating a major challenge for the team.\
As a result, I took full ownership of this feature - delivering a C++ plugin that enables artists to paint the mold across the environment, implementing the intended gameplay mechanics and optimizing the performance for it.

### Light beam game mechanic

According to the brief, this is a Zelda‑style puzzle game built around a light beam that player can redirect. Key level elements include mirrors for reflecting the beam and sensors that react when the beam hits them.\
As a result, I implemented the gameplay mechanic.

*The video below showcases the light beam mechanic. **This video should be updated.***

### Lighting and optimization

Our game's performance was terrible, and we had no lighting artists. Recently, I learned that Unreal’s Lumen is resource‑heavy and not always necessary.\
Disabling Lumen doubled performance but worsened lighting. I teamed up with the environment artist to completely revamp our lighting system.\
By turning off Lumen and overhauling the lighting, we achieved far better visual results.
