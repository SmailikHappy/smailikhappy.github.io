## General information

It is an action adventure set in a corrupted Byzantine cathedral. A player plays as a heroic soldier who must cleanse and illuminate the path in front of *them* by harnessing the power of the light with the help of the companion.

The game is a part of course assignment in my university. We are working on it as team of 15 people.
