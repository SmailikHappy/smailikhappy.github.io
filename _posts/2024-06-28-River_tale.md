## General information

This is a group project completed at [Breda University](https://www.buas.nl/) as part of a course assignment. The goal is to **release (part of) a “presentable” game demo in cross-disciplinary teams** on a structured and known development challenge. 

> This project is finished and has a PC version on [itch.io](https://buas.itch.io/river-tale).
{: .prompt-tip}

The idea of the game is unusual. We are using university XR stage as a game environment with custom controllers and tracking system providing a unique theme-park like experience.

## Gameplay

In this immersive multiplayer XR adventure you navigate, strategize, and communicate to defeat enemies and reach the gate to the overworld.
