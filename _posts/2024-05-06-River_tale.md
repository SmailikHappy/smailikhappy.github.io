## General information

This is a group project completed at [Breda University](https://www.buas.nl/) as part of a course assignment. The goal is to **release (part of) a “presentable” game demo in cross-disciplinary teams** on a structured and known development challenge. 

> This project is in production phase, so updates are incoming.

The idea of the game is unusual. We are using our universities XR stage as a game environment making a unique game experience, however the game itself pretty simple.

## Game's prototype

You are a pirate team that escapes hell. Some creatures are your way breaking your ship, so you need to shoot them and repair your cannons if they got harmed.

*There is a small trailer created by designers before launch of production phase.*

- I setup Unreal project to use XR stage

> Project's deadline is June 28th, so this post will be updated a bunch more times.
