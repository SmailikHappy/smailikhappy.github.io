During my second year at [university](https://www.buas.nl/), we had a group task to create custom cross platform engine. As a group, we decided to use blender as our main level editor. Me and [Mark Follinus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-follinus-0b5b5a188/) were working on this plugin and this article explains more details on how it works.

> The only code that can be shared is a python script from blender. The code of custom engine is under NDA and cannot be shared.
