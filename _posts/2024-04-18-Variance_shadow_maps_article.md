## What is this all about?

During my second year at [university](https://www.buas.nl/), we were divided into groups tasked with creating a custom engine that might be used to develop a game in the last quarter of the year.

As the graphics programmer for my team, I was responsible for implementing shadows. In this article, I will explain why I chose variance shadow maps and how they function.

## Why variance shadow maps
Initially, I implemented the basic shadow mapping algorithm. However, the results were disappointing: shadows were pixelated, and shadow acne was the most annoying problem to face.

// Probably, I shall mention PCF

After researching for a while, I decided to use a little more complex shadow mapping algorithm that provides efficient filtering, cheap edge softening, and a solution to the biasing problems of standard shadow maps.

## The pipeline

### Generating buffers & shadow maps

A shadow map is a texture containing light-view information, which is essentially the depth information of how far the light has reached.

> Algorithm to draw the shadow map is in the [next section](#shadow-pass--render-shadow-maps)
{: .prompt-info}

Typically, we would use only depth textures, but this algorithm requires to store 2 float values per pixel - depth and depth squared `float2( depth, depth * depth )`. Consequently, the texture will have 2 channels.

> You need to store the squared depth because you can't recalculate it after the filter pass; the math behind this will be [explained later](#why-we-cannot-recalculate-the-values-after-the-filter-pass).
{: .prompt-warning}

The size and number of shadow maps used per light source depends on the developer's choice. In my particular case, I used one large texture for the directional light, one small texture for the spot light, and a small cube texture for the point light. Coloured shadows are not taken into account in this implementation.



### Shadow pass / render shadow maps

Now, we are doing the same as all shadow mapping algorithms. We will render the scene from a light's point of view, which is similar to how a camera works. In this case, we are only interested in the depth information. The camera settings are unique per light type:

**Directional light**:
- Uses orthographic projection
- The *camera* is positioned far away from the center of the scene (or the player), so that all objects that can occlude are within the light's viewing frustum.
- The *camera* direction is the same as the light's direction

**Spot light**:
- Uses perspective projection
- The *camera* is located at the spot light's position
- The perspective FOV angle matches the light's angle
- The *camera* faces the same direction as the light

**Point light**:
- Uses 6 perspective projections to render a cube texture
- The *camera* is positioned at the point light's location
- The perspective FOV angle is 90Â° for each face of the cube texture.

> I recommend you [this beginner tutorial from OGLDEV](https://youtu.be/uhCbfZ_L7uc?si=f9bDW9sbryrW3Tsx) that explains how to render shadow maps for point light sources. There are some nuances.

After setting all the necessary parameters, we pass the scene mesh data and render it to the shadow map in the form of `float2( depth, depth * depth )`.



### Filter pass (blurring)

In this pass, we need to blur the shadow map values. I have used a [Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) algorithm in my case. This algorithm is applied twice - horizontally and vertically.

```hlsl
void main()
{
	vec4 pixelColor = vec4(0.0f);

	vec2 finalUV[7];
	uint i = 0;

	for (float offset = -3.0; offset <= 3.0; offset += 1.0f)
	{
		finalUV[i++] = clamp(v_uv + offset * u_blurScale, float2(0.0f), float2(1.0f));
	}
	
	pixelColor += texture(raw_shadowMap, finalUV[0]) * (1.0f / 64.0f);
	pixelColor += texture(raw_shadowMap, finalUV[1]) * (6.0f / 64.0f);
	pixelColor += texture(raw_shadowMap, finalUV[2]) * (15.0f / 64.0f);
	pixelColor += texture(raw_shadowMap, finalUV[3]) * (20.0f / 64.0f);
	pixelColor += texture(raw_shadowMap, finalUV[4]) * (15.0f / 64.0f);
	pixelColor += texture(raw_shadowMap, finalUV[5]) * (6.0f / 64.0f);
	pixelColor += texture(raw_shadowMap, finalUV[6]) * (1.0f / 64.0f);

	frag_color = vec4(pixelColor.xy, 0.0f, 0.0f);
}
```

#### Why we cannot recalculate the values after the filter pass?

..show mathematics..

`((a+b) / c)^2 != (a^2 + b^2) / c`\
`(a+b)^2 / c^2 != (a^2 + b^2) / c`\
`(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) / c != a^2 + b^2`\
`a^2 + 2ab + b^2 != c*a^2 + c*b^2`



### Render pass

Code to sample the shadow map

- `shadowMap` - The shadow map texture to sample
- `coords` - The texture coordinates to sample the shadow map at
- `compareValue` - The depth value to compare with the shadow map
- `varianceMin` - The minimum allowed variance (to avoid division by zero)
- `lightBleedReductionAmount` - The amount of light bleed reduction to apply

```hlsl
float linstep(float low, float high, float v)
{
    return clamp((v-low) / (high-low), 0.0f, 1.0f);
}

float SampleVarianceShadowMap(sampler2D shadowMap, vec2 coords, float compareValue, float varianceMin, float lightBleedReductionAmount)
{
    vec2 moments = texture(shadowMap, coords.xy).xy;
	
	float p = step(compareValue, moments.x);
	float variance = max(moments.y - moments.x * moments.x, varianceMin);
	
	float d = compareValue - moments.x;
	float pMax = linstep(lightBleedReductionAmount, 1.0, variance / (variance + d*d));
	
	return min(max(p, pMax), 1.0);
}
```

> The values I used for OpenGL
>
```cpp
const float c_directLightBleedReductionAmount = 0.6f;
const float c_directVarianceMin = 0.000002f;
const float c_spotLightBleedReductionAmount = 0.9997f;
const float c_spotVarianceMin = 0.0000004f;
const float c_pointLightBleedReductionAmount = 0.997f;
const float c_pointVarianceMin = 0.000009f;
```
