## General information

When I was studying in school, I was constantly learning new things. One day, I set a goal to create a Discord bot that could facilitate the game called **Spy** for me and my friends. As a result, I developed programming skills and gained proficiency in using the Discord API. This was my first succesfull project that I am proud of.
