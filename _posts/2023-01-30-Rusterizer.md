description: Project made on masterclasses to learn language Rust and deepen knowledge in graphic's algorithms
---

## General information

I was participating in rust rasterizer masterclasses hosted in [my university](https://www.buas.nl/).

The masterclasses primarily focused on teaching students the programming language Rust, as well as the mathematics and algorithms involved in rendering pipelines. While I did gain some experience with the new syntax, there is still much more to learn.

> This project was undertaken during my early stages as a programmer, and my main objective was to learn new concepts rather than produce polished code. As a result, **<u>the quality of the code is lacking.</u>**

## Features of final project
- Loading a `.gltf`{: .filepath} model
- Applying `.jpg`{: .filepath} texture onto the loaded model
- Triangle rasterization using Bresenham's algorithm
- Free camera movement (<kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> and mouse)
