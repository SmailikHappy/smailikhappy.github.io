## General information

I was participating in rust rasterizer masterclasses hosted in my university.\
You can see the final codebase via this link to the [GitHub](https://github.com/SmailikHappy/rusterizer) repository.

The masterclasses primarily focused on teaching students the programming language Rust, as well as the mathematics and algorithms involved in rendering pipelines. While I did gain some experience with the new syntax, there is still much more to learn.\
It's important to note that this project was undertaken during my early stages as a programmer, and my main objective was to learn new concepts rather than produce polished code. As a result, the quality of the code may be lacking.
