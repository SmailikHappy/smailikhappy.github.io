## General information

This plugin allows you to play as Slenderman against your friends in Minecraft.

I developed it during the summer break amid the ongoing Covid pandemic. My aim was to create something for my favorite game and enjoy playing it with my friends.\
Through this project, I learned the syntax of Java and experienced basic operations with objects in object-oriented programming (OOP).

If you're interested in playing the game or learning more about it, you can check out the [article](/posts/Slender_man_plugin_article) detailing this project.
