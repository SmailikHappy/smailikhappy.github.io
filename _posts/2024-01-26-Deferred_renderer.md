title: "Deferred renderer with PBR on PS5"

This is a self-study project that implements deferred lighting to illuminate the scene, with support for physically based rendering (PBR). The renderer is written in C++ for the PS5 using the low-level *Prospero* API.

## Additional information about the project

This project was undertaken as part of a university course assignment aimed at deepening expertise in a desired topic. I chose to focus on exploring new methods to optimize the renderer and delving deeper into low-level APIs.
The project codebase cannot be shared due to a protection of NDA.
